# FracturingTutorial
Animating fractured 3D model (mesh) in Unity with physics/c# code on CPU/shaders on GPU.

Prefracture 3D model in Blender.
Animate methods:
- just use physics
- do transformations with c# script on CPU
- do transformations with vertex displacement shader on GPU. Requires combining mesh in certain way - code included.
